# SUP-Scout
A Flutter application for finding spots to practice watersports, primarily standup-paddel (SUP)

## Features
The app features a map which can dynamically load spots around a location of interest.
Users can upload new spots and rate existing spots.
A user account can be created to make the spots independent of the device.

## Implementation
The application was developed with Flutter and is using a firebase backend to save and share spots between users.
The google maps API was used for the map display and autocomplete functions when searching spots.
